Hello, my name is Kai!

This is my take of the "Challenge Project: Company Home Page" by Codecademy!

I made a website homepage for a pizzeria by testing my HTML and CSS knowledge at its fullest!
You can see a header with the following sections: About Us, Service, Locations and the button "Contact Us" (which leads the user to call the Pizzeria by applying the command "<a href="tel:"></a>").
Then we have a photo gallery that represents the various types of pizza and the staff.
